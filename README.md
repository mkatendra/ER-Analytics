# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **data-driven dashboard** designed to monitor key **Emergency Room (ER) performance metrics**. Built using **Excel**, it visualizes patient flow, wait times, satisfaction scores, and departmental referrals to drive **data-backed decisions** in hospital management.

## 🎯 Project Goals  
- **Monitor ER Performance**: Track patient visits, wait times, and satisfaction levels.  
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Analyze delays and referral trends to optimize hospital operations.  
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights for hospital administrators.  

## 🔍 Business Needs  
Hospitals require **real-time analytics** to improve **patient experience**, **reduce waiting times**, and **streamline operations**. This dashboard delivers clear, **interactive visualizations** to support strategic decision-making.  

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- **Total ER Footfall**: Number of patients visiting the emergency room.  
- **Patient Wait Time**: Average time before being attended.  
- **Satisfaction Score**: Patient feedback on ER experience.  
- **Admission Status**: Percentage of admitted vs. non-admitted patients.  
- **Gender & Age Demographics**: Breakdown of patient distribution.  
- **Patient Attendance Timeliness**: On-time vs. delayed consultations.  
- **Departmental Referrals**: Number of patients referred to specialized departments.  

## 🚀 Approach  
1. **Data Collection**: Sourced ER visit records, patient feedback, and wait-time data.  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaned and structured the data for accurate analysis.  
3. **Visualization**: Used **Excel Charts & Conditional Formatting** for meaningful insights.  
4. **Analysis & Insights**: Interpreted data to identify trends and optimization opportunities.  

## 🔥 Key Insights  
- **59% of patients experienced delays** in attendance, highlighting a need for process improvements.  
- **Middle-aged adults had the highest ER visits**, requiring resource allocation for their care.  
- **General Practice had the most referrals**, suggesting possible **overload in primary care units**.
